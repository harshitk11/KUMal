# Data Collection Framework used to collect hardware telemetry logs from a Google Pixel-3 Android Smartphone

The data-collection architecture consists of three main components: the interaction module, the data-collection module, and the orchestrator module.
- The interaction module interacts with the application while it executes.
- The data-collection module collects the hardware telemetry logs in the bakcground while the application is executing in the foreground.
- The orchestrator is responsible for synchronizing all the different sub-tasks.
